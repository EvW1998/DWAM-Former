### Generate `metadata_daicwoz_crop_resample.csv` file for DAIC-WOZ
* `metadata_daicwoz_crop_resample.csv` records the sample `name`, `label`, and `state`.
* Similar to the Pitt, the DAIC-WOZ corpus provides speech samples at the dialogue level.
* The official `.csv` files are in `PATH_to_DAICWOZ/train_split_Depression_AVEC2017.csv` and `PATH_to_DAICWOZ/dev_split_Depression_AVEC2017.csv`.  Since the labels of test data are not provided, we use only the train set and the development set. The `PHQ8_Binary` value is used as the `label` in our experiment.
* `XXX_P/` folder (`XXX` is the Participant_ID) includes `XXX_AUDIO.wav` and `XXX_TRANSCRIPT.csv`. The transcript file contains the start time and stop time of each utterance. Based on these timestamps, we extract the participant's utterances and save them as separate files. For example, `XXX_sY_AUDIO.wav` denotes the `Y-th` utterance of the participant `XXX`. Also, `XXX_sY_AUDIO.wav` is the `name` in `metadata_daicwoz_crop_resample.csv`.
* Since the DAIC-WOZ suffers from sample imbalance and some participants' utterances are quite short, we resample the corpus in our experiment. In detail, when the participant belongs to label `0`, we select his/her longest 18 utterances as the training or testing samples. The longest 46 utterances are selected when the participant belongs to label `1`.
* `state` column records whether the sample is from the training set or the development set.
